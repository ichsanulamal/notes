## Why Independent Quants Don't Exist

**Can You Be an Independent Quant?**

**The Short Answer:** Generally, no. It's extremely difficult to be an independent quant and be successful, for several reasons.

**Historical Context:**
Many people look back at the 80s and 90s, when some quants and proprietary trading firms made substantial profits, and think they can replicate that success on their own today. However, the landscape has changed significantly, making it much more challenging to achieve similar results independently.

**Why It's Challenging to Be an Independent Quant:**

1. **Initial Capital Requirements:**
   - **Example Scenario:** Imagine you start with $1 million. If you achieve a 10% return annually, that's $100,000. However, this assumes you have no expenses and no salary. In reality, you have costs like transaction fees, data, technology, and potentially salaries if you hire help.
   
2. **Risk and Uncertainty:**
   - If you don’t achieve your projected returns (e.g., only making 6% instead of 10%), you could end up making significantly less, which might not cover your expenses or your desired salary.

3. **Scaling Challenges:**
   - To make substantial profits, you need to scale up. This means attracting investors and managing a larger operation. Without scaling, your profits remain limited. Running a firm requires substantial infrastructure, including legal, accounting, and compliance teams.

4. **Costs and Overheads:**
   - Running a firm involves substantial costs beyond just trading. These include salaries, legal fees, technology infrastructure, and other operational expenses. For many, these costs make it impractical to remain independent.

**Advantages of Working for a Firm:**

1. **Stable Income:**
   - When you work for a firm, you get a base salary, often starting around $80,000 to $100,000, which can increase significantly with experience and performance. This salary is not contingent on the performance of your trading strategies.

2. **Resources and Infrastructure:**
   - Firms provide the necessary infrastructure, including data access, technology, and legal compliance. This reduces your personal risk and upfront investment.

3. **Reduced Personal Risk:**
   - Working for a firm means you’re not personally liable for trading losses. Firms absorb these risks and offer a more stable environment for you to develop and apply your quantitative strategies.

4. **Career Growth and Networking:**
   - Working in a firm helps build your network and gain experience, which can be valuable if you decide to start your own firm in the future. Established professionals with industry experience often find it easier to attract investors and launch successful firms.

**Conclusion:**

While the romantic notion of being an independent quant is appealing, the reality is that it’s much more practical and safer to work for an established firm. Firms provide stability, resources, and a structured environment that independent quants often lack. If you aspire to start your own fund, gaining experience and building a network within a firm can be a crucial first step.

## Why I Dislike Talking About Trading and Investing (TT - S2E8)

On my usual YouTube channel, I focus on technical aspects like measuring autocorrelation functions, partial autocorrelation functions, ADF testing, and the nitty-gritty of coding. We break down mathematical theories and their derivations to understand the underpinnings of various financial models. By the end of a video, you might be feeling a bit overwhelmed if you’re not deeply into finance, which seems to be the point for some of my viewers. They often tell me that while they appreciate the content, the technical videos can be a bit over their heads. 

Now, let’s address why I shy away from discussing investing and trading. 

### The Basics and Beyond

Many finance students and amateur investors lack a solid grasp of basic financial concepts. This isn’t just a casual observation; it's a recurring theme I encounter. Even with a finance degree, people often miss out on core principles like diversification, capital asset pricing, and the real-world limitations of financial theories. 

The real issue is that these basic concepts are crucial for understanding more complex financial strategies. Without them, it’s like trying to build a house on a shaky foundation. For instance, many people don’t realize that basic theories are built on assumptions that don’t always hold true in the real world. This is why theory alone isn’t enough—you need to adapt and refine it with rigorous modeling and statistical analysis.

### Risk and Reality

One major frustration I have is seeing amateur traders and investors treat the market like a game of chance. They often use simplistic methods—like flipping a coin to decide whether to buy or sell a stock—without considering the underlying risks. And when they do make money, they attribute it to their brilliance rather than the market conditions or sheer luck.

Leverage is another area where misunderstanding runs rampant. People get excited about how leveraging can magnify returns but fail to grasp that it also magnifies losses. You might start with $100, borrow another $100, and if your investment doubles, it seems like a huge win. But if the investment loses value, your losses can exceed your initial investment, leading to a dangerous situation.

### The Illusion of Expertise

A lot of people are under the impression that they can replicate the success of seasoned investors like Warren Buffett or Charlie Munger by following their strategies without understanding the full context, timing, and nuances. Just because someone has succeeded doesn’t mean you can simply copy their actions without understanding the broader picture.

### The Business of Trading

Trading is often misunderstood as a quick way to make money, but it’s as much a business as manufacturing toilet paper. You need a solid strategy, capital, resources, and continuous adaptation to market changes. It’s not about making random bets; it’s about having a well-thought-out plan, monitoring its performance, and being ready to adjust as needed.

### Why I Avoid the Topic

I avoid discussing trading and investing in depth because it often feels like a waste of time when the foundational understanding is lacking. It’s not just about throwing out random tips or strategies—it’s about understanding the deep, complex nature of financial markets and the rigorous analysis that goes into successful trading.

In conclusion, the reason I steer clear of extensive discussions on investing and trading is that without a solid grasp of basic finance and an appreciation for the complexity involved, these topics can become counterproductive. It's not just about having fancy theories or strategies; it's about understanding the basics, applying them rigorously, and being prepared for the inherent risks and uncertainties.

Thanks for tuning in, and as always, until next time!

## Lessons from my First Million Dollars

**Dimitri:** Hey YouTube, it’s Dimitri! Today, we’re diving into how I made my first million dollars. That’s right, I officially hit the million-dollar mark at the end of 2020. It's a big achievement for me, but I want to share some insights and tips from my journey. 

**1. Making a Million Dollars Takes a Lot of Money**

Let’s start by clearing up a common misconception: making a million dollars doesn’t mean you’re filthy rich with stacks of cash lying around. In reality, it’s a process that involves significant investment. Here’s a bit about my background:

You can achieve a million-dollar milestone through various careers. My path was just one of many. I pursued a finance degree, hoping it would lead to a successful career. However, after graduating, I realized I needed more specialized knowledge. Corporate finance felt limiting, and there was a barrier to entry in traditional finance roles. 

**Tip:** If you aim to work in a specific industry like finance or fashion, studying in or near the industry’s hub—such as New York City for finance—can dramatically increase your job prospects. 

**2. Invest in Your Education**

I invested heavily in my education, with my wife and I collectively spending $160,000 on student loans for our degrees. After interest, the total was closer to $200,000. This investment was crucial for landing good jobs.

**Tip:** Research and choose the right educational path for your career goals. A master’s degree or specialized training might be necessary, and the financial investment can be substantial, but it’s often worth it. 

**3. Location Matters**

I moved several times for work—from Washington to Michigan, then to Dallas, and finally New York City before returning to Dallas. Each move came with significant costs, including higher living expenses and taxes. For example, living in New York City cost me about $3,800 a month, compared to a lower cost of living in Dallas.

**Tip:** Be strategic about where you live based on your career goals. High-cost areas might offer higher salaries, but the cost of living can eat into your earnings. Balancing salary and living expenses is crucial for maximizing savings.

**4. Specialize and Excel**

As Adam Smith’s *The Wealth of Nations* suggests, specialization can significantly increase your earning potential. Being a specialist in your field often pays more than being a generalist.

**Tip:** Focus on becoming highly skilled in a specific area. While specialization can come with risks if the market shifts, it generally offers higher rewards. 

**5. Focus on Adding Value**

The most important takeaway is to focus on creating value rather than just chasing money. Whether it’s through a career, side hustle, or business, the more value you provide, the more you’ll earn in the long run. I’ve been doing YouTube for several years now, and while the direct profit is small, it complements my career and keeps me engaged with new information.

**Tip:** Invest in yourself and your skills, and concentrate on adding value to your clients or audience. Passion and a focus on value creation will drive long-term success and satisfaction.
