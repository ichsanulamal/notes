1. **Historical Origins of Money**:
   - Money has roots in various forms of exchange, including:
     - Inheritance
     - Compensation for injuries (similar to modern lawsuits)
     - Collectibles (e.g., shells among the Yurok Indians)

2. **Functions of Money**:
   - **Medium of Exchange**: Facilitates transactions.
   - **Store of Value**: Holds value over time.
   - **Unit of Account**: Provides a common measure for valuing goods and services.

3. **Cryptocurrencies**:
   - Debate exists on their functionality as money:
     - Some argue lack of use as a medium of exchange (e.g., Bitcoin).
     - Others suggest they serve as a store of value (like a Swiss bank account).

4. **Value Determinants of Money**:
   - **Scarcity**: Limited supply ensures value.
   - **Ease of Storage and Transport**: Secure and practical storage options (e.g., hardware wallets).
   - **Replicable Ledger**: Distributed ledger technology (DLT) maintains transaction integrity.

### Blockchain Technology

1. **Definition and Structure**:
   - Blockchain functions as a decentralized, distributed ledger.
   - Multiple nodes maintain copies of the ledger, ensuring validation and security.

2. **Transaction Validation**:
   - Each transaction is recorded in a ledger that is publicly accessible.
   - Nodes verify transactions, ensuring all copies of the ledger match.

3. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Defined as self-executing contracts with the agreement directly written into code.
   - They automate and verify performance:
     - **Verification**: Ensures parties fulfill contractual obligations.
     - **Automation**: Executes agreements without third-party intervention (e.g., escrow services).

4. **Examples of Smart Contracts**:
   - Vending machines as simple smart contracts (input leading to an output).
   - More complex contracts involving multiple signatures for transactions.

### Future Implications
