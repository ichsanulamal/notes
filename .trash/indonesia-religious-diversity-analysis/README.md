Here are some resources to see which company backed or supported a political candidate in Indonesia:

In addition to these resources, there are a number of news organizations and NGOs that track political financing in Indonesia. You can also find information about political financing on the websites of political parties and individual candidates.

Here are some additional tips for finding information about which company backed or supported a political candidate in Indonesia:

* **Use keywords such as "donasi politik" (political donation) or "dana kampanye" (campaign funds) when searching for information online.**

* **Be aware that not all donations are reported, and that some companies may donate to multiple candidates.**

* **Use multiple sources of information to cross-check your findings.**

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
