# David Goggins: PUSH YOURSELF EVERYDAY — Morning Motivation

### Key Concepts on Self-Talk and Visualization

1. **Mindset in Adversity**  
   - Use self-talk to transform negative experiences into motivation.
   - Challenge your limits by questioning, “Who would still be going?” and remind yourself, “You are.”

2. **Leveraging Past Struggles**  
   - Reflect on your history and identify how far you've come.
   - Use your difficult background as fuel to surpass others who may have had easier starts.

3. **Avoiding Pity**  
   - Pity can hinder progress; it may feel comforting initially but ultimately drains self-esteem and strength.
   - Instead of seeking sympathy, focus on personal growth and overcoming challenges.

4. **Present Moment Focus**  
   - Your feelings about the past should not dictate your present actions.
   - Every moment spent in self-pity is time lost in pursuing your goals.

5. **Adaptability and Humility**  
   - Embrace challenges as opportunities for growth. 
   - Cultivate humility to ground yourself and stay focused on your tasks, regardless of how menial they may seem.

6. **Learning from Every Experience**  
   - Understand that every role, no matter how lowly, offers lessons that contribute to your proficiency and future success.
   - Attitude determines your path; stay humble and eager to learn.

7. **Example of Master Sergeant William Crawford**  
   - His story illustrates the power of humility and service.
   - Despite earning the Medal of Honor, he remained grounded, demonstrating that true strength lies in selflessness and continuous learning.

8. **Trained Humility**  
   - Cultivate a mindset of lifelong learning.
   - Recognize that growth comes from being open to new experiences and learning from every situation, no matter how challenging.

By focusing on these principles, you can develop a resilient mindset that embraces challenges, learns from experiences, and thrives on continuous growth.
