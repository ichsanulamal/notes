## 1. Why Blockchain?

The Blockchain space is incredibly dynamic and offers a chance to revolutionize financial systems and more. Here’s why it’s such an exciting field:

#### The Excitement
- **Reinventing Wall Street**: Blockchain automates and encodes traditional financial operations.
- **Building a Digital Economy**: Like the early internet era, Blockchain is digitizing and programming previously scarce resources.

#### Opportunities and Challenges
- **High Demand, Limited Supply**: There's a significant gap in Blockchain skills, as it isn’t widely taught in traditional education. This results in high demand for trained professionals.
- **Entry-Level Contributions**: You don’t need to build a new Blockchain from scratch. Simple projects like developing a block explorer can make a significant impact.

#### Compensation
- **High Rewards**: Due to the high demand and limited supply of skilled professionals, those with Blockchain expertise are often well-compensated.

Now is a great time to get into Blockchain due to these opportunities and the rapidly growing need for skilled professionals.

## 2. Influence of Blockchain

Blockchain is transforming industries worldwide. Here’s how:

#### Personal Identity
- **Current Issue**: Centralized databases controlled by major corporations are prone to security breaches (e.g., Equifax 2017 hack).
- **Blockchain Solution**: Decentralized data storage with cryptographic security makes data breaches nearly impossible.

#### Supply Chain Management
- **Current Issue**: Managing supply chains involves complex record-keeping across multiple companies with little information sharing.
- **Blockchain Solution**: Blockchain can make product information publicly available and trackable, enhancing transparency and reducing record-keeping costs.

#### Other Industries
- **Medicine**: Secure and accurate patient information.
- **Finance**: Secure, global money transfers.
- **Government**: Transparent and secure elections.

Blockchain is not just a technology but a transformative tool with the potential to improve various aspects of our lives. We’ll dive deeper into these topics as you progress through the course.

## 3. Blockchain Overview

**Blockchain** is a transformative technology that provides a decentralized method for recording transactions. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works and the problems it addresses:

#### What is Blockchain?

- **Definition**: A blockchain is a shared database or ledger where transactions are recorded. Each transaction is stored in a "block," and these blocks are linked together in a "chain."
- **Origin**: The concept of Blockchain was popularized by Bitcoin, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin was the first blockchain application, but since then, many other blockchains have emerged.

#### How Does Blockchain Work?

1. **Creating a Transaction**:
   - Imagine sending 10 Eudacity coins to a friend. This involves creating a transaction record: who sent it, who received it, and the amount.

2. **Broadcasting the Transaction**:
   - The transaction is shared with a network of users. These users work together to group transactions into a block.

3. **Adding the Block to the Chain**:
   - Once a block is filled with transactions, it is assigned a unique value called a **hash**. A hash is a unique fingerprint that identifies the block’s data.
   - Each block also contains the hash of the previous block, linking them together. This forms a chain of blocks, creating a permanent and unchangeable record.

4. **Security**:
   - Changing any data in a block would alter its hash, making the block invalid. This ensures the integrity of the blockchain.

#### Benefits of Blockchain

- **Decentralization**: Data is not controlled by a central authority but is shared across the network.
- **Immutability**: Once added, data in a block cannot be easily changed, ensuring a reliable historical record.

Blockchain’s ability to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized method for recording transactions opens up exciting possibilities across various industries. We will explore these concepts and their applications in more detail throughout the program.

## 4. Blockchain Motivation

Excitement about blockchain:

- **Disruptive Potential**: Blockchain has the potential to impact various sectors by breaking down traditional barriers and facilitating transactions without intermediaries.
- **IoT Integration**: Blockchain is well-suited for machine-to-machine transactions, enhancing automation and efficiency.
- **Global Transactions**: The technology enables seamless transactions across borders, which can revolutionize how we interact with different communities and industries.

**Key Applications**:
- **Global Transactions**: Eliminates borders in financial transactions.
- **Transparency and Efficiency**: Improves records management and data accuracy in various sectors, including government and healthcare.
