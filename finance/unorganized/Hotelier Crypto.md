**Bitcoin Drop - Guys, it's normal**

To stay calm, let's analyze the global picture. Recently, the M2 Supply increased. M2 Supply is the total amount of new dollars printed, excluding the ones already circulating. You can check this on the Federal Reserve's website.

**M2 Supply May Increase:**
- The highest since February 2023.
- Confirmed as a source of US liquidity along with debt and RRP (Reverse Repo).

**Bitcoin's Relationship with M2 Supply:**
- Bitcoin thrives on newly printed money (M2 Supply).
- If the economy hasn't doubled but the Fed's assets have, the extra money comes from M2 Supply, fueling Bitcoin.

**M2 Supply Effect:**
- Impacts the financial market a year later. The current market situation reflects June 2023's M2 Supply.
- Liquidity dried up because M2 Supply decreased and interest rates stayed high at 5.5%.

**Bitcoin in June 2023:**
- Price was $30K. By June 2024, it doubled. 

**US Inflation Peak (June 2022):**
- Highest at 9.1%.
- M2 Supply first dropped, marking Bitcoin's bottom in November 2022 at $15K.
- Impact felt 5 months later; marked the buy-in point at $16K, and sell at $32K for a 100% gain.

**Bitcoin Market Calls:**
- Encouraged followers to buy Bitcoin in small amounts collectively.

**M2 Supply 2024 Impact:**
- First positive this year.
- Impact will peak in February 2025.
- Short-term thinkers focus month-to-month; thus, the impact might be felt by July 2024.
- Aiming for a 20% gain seems reasonable.

**Ideal Scenario for Bitcoin:**
- If M2 Supply rises, RRP grows slowly, and US debt increases moderately, Bitcoin should rise steadily.
- If M2 Supply rises significantly and RRP drops, with US debt hitting $35T, it would lead to a market "party" (boom).

**Investment Strategy:**
- Take profits (TP) when signaled.
- Aim for 20% gains repeatedly, leading to substantial overall returns.
- The main goal is security, not just profit. If an investment is unsafe, it should be avoided.

**Reverse Repo (RRP):**
- RRP involves the central bank borrowing money from the market using government securities as collateral.
- A rising RRP means tighter liquidity.

**Concerns:**
- If both RRP and M2 Supply rise, M2 should outpace RRP.
- If RRP rises faster, money becomes harder to find, affecting the economy negatively, especially during election periods.

**Explanation and Strategy:**
- Stay calm and informed.
- Understanding RRP and its implications helps in making better investment decisions.

**Additional Resources:**
- Link to learn more about RRP and its impact.

## 2024-07-23

Before we discuss next week's data, let's review this week's data to understand what we got right and what we got wrong.

**China's Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Predicted to drop. This means China is likely using its reserves. China's gold purchases have decreased. Is China intervening in the market? No, because the Yuan is not weakening; it's actually getting stronger.

**SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate):** This has increased, indicating that liquidity (availability of money) is drying up. 

**US Consumer Credit:** Increased by $11 billion, meaning people are using credit cards to cover expenses. 

**Hawkish vs. Dovish:** Powell was not hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to fight inflation), implying a dovish stance (favoring lower interest rates). He said they won't raise interest rates and don't need to wait for inflation to hit 2% to ease monetary policy.

**China's CPI (Consumer Price Index):** Below the forecast at 0.2%. If China's inflation decreases, the Yuan strengthens, leading to deflation, which can harm the economy.

**China's M2 Money Supply:** Increased slightly by 0.22%, or 7% annually.

**US Inflation:** Predicted correctly to drop to 3%. Both Chinese and US inflation decreasing could mean either the US is manipulating numbers due to the upcoming election, or liquidity is truly drying up. 

**China's Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Over $3 trillion, indicating tight liquidity because funds are being redirected.

**Producer Price Index (PPI):** Expected to drop, showing the Fed is reducing inflation by sacrificing jobs. If it rises, it won't be much due to lack of demand.

**US Dollar Index (DXY):** Dropped to nearly 104.00 due to the accurate data.

**Chart Analysis:** Data trends are mostly correct.

##-

**Next Week's Data:**

**Monday, July 15, 2024:**

- **China's GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** If inflation decreases, GDP might fall below 5.3%. The government may need to increase liquidity but avoid it leaking to the US by replacing foreign stock ownership with local stocks. This is why foreign businesses are pressured to leave China.

- **Bitcoin:** If GDP falls, it could signal that the government will inject liquidity into the market, boosting Bitcoin. The aim is to prevent deeper deflation and stimulate the economy.

- **China's Retail Sales:** If US retail sales drop, China's retail sales should rise, putting pressure on the dollar and causing DXY to fall. Yuan should strengthen unless intentionally weakened.

- **China's Housing Prices:** Expected to continue falling. Lower housing prices will shift investments from property to equities (stocks), protecting against future inflation when China shifts reserves from the dollar.

- **Fed Powell & Daly Speaking:** Expected to provide minor corrections. Powell cannot remain dovish indefinitely.

**Tuesday, July 16, 2024:**

- **US Retail Sales:** Expected to show a decline, though previous numbers might be revised to appear better. If retail sales increase, DXY will rise. If they decrease, DXY falls and Bitcoin rises.

- **NAHB Housing Price Index:** US housing prices are expected to drop, indicating drying liquidity. Rising SOFR and subsidized housing prices suggest corporate rather than individual purchases.

**Wednesday, July 17, 2024:**

- **Housing Starts:** Expected to drop along with falling housing prices, leading to higher Bitcoin prices. If actual numbers are better than predicted, DXY might not be strong.

- **Building Permits:** Expected to drop due to a lack of money among the population for new homes.

- **Beige Book:** A summary of economic opinions compiled by the Fed, likely to present a favorable image of the government.

**Thursday, July 18, 2024:**

- **Jobless Claims:** Expected to be manipulated. Lower unemployment is seen as positive, indicating that the Fed might start easing policy and thus reducing the DXY.

**Friday, July 19, 2024:**

- **William and Bostic Speaking:** Likely to provide further insights or corrections.

##-

**Bitcoin Market Analysis:**

Market makers, such as Jane Street, are influential in controlling Bitcoin prices, particularly through futures and ETFs. This control allows them to influence prices despite positive economic data that should push Bitcoin higher.

**Key Points:**

- After positive economic data, Jane Street short-sells Bitcoin, which is then followed by similar actions in Asian markets, keeping Bitcoin prices suppressed.
- Asset managers like BlackRock buy Bitcoin ETFs at these lower prices, consolidating control over Bitcoin in the hands of US entities.
- This manipulation is evident in the discrepancy between economic data and Bitcoin's market reaction.

**Conclusion:**

- **Bitcoin Trend:** After a short-sell by Jane Street and subsequent Asian market actions, Bitcoin might initially drop but could recover as asset managers continue to buy ETFs.
- **Economic Data Impact:** Economic indicators and their manipulation affect Bitcoin and other assets, revealing deeper market strategies by major players.

The text you provided covers various economic concepts and observations related to global financial markets, U.S. economic policy, cryptocurrency trends, and historical references. Here’s a summary in bullet points with explanations for key terms and concepts:

- **Barter vs. Monetary System**:
  - Barter was an earlier form of trade before money was introduced. The text suggests that the simplicity of barter provided peace, as opposed to the complex financial systems of today, which often involve exploitation and inequality.

- **Economic Development and Sacrifice**:
  - The text discusses how countries like Japan, Singapore, and Germany became economically advanced by sacrificing certain aspects of their autonomy or ethics, implying that economic progress often comes at a moral cost.

- **Carry Trade**:
  - Japan engages in a carry trade by borrowing its own currency at low interest rates (through Japanese Government Bonds - JGB) and investing in higher-yielding assets like U.S. dollars. This strategy involves leveraging low-cost debt to earn higher returns elsewhere.

- **Federal Reserve (Fed) and U.S. Treasury (UST)**:
  - The Federal Reserve’s budget impacts the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). A surplus in the budget usually strengthens the dollar, while a deficit weakens it. However, the text highlights that the U.S. economy is heavily reliant on debt, and the Fed’s balance sheet has doubled without a corresponding economic growth.

- **M2 Money Supply**:
  - M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. The text suggests that the increase in M2 leads to inflation because more money in circulation drives up prices, which in turn affects the value of the dollar.

- **Producer Price Index (PPI) vs. Consumer Price Index (CPI)**:
  - PPI measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, while CPI measures the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services. An increase in PPI typically leads to an increase in CPI, as higher production costs are passed on to consumers.

- **Inflation and GDP**:
  - The text connects inflation with GDP, stating that an increase in GDP often leads to higher inflation. This is because higher economic activity usually means more money circulating in the economy, which can drive up prices.

- **Federal Reserve Policy and Unemployment**:
  - The Fed's dual mandate is to promote maximum employment and stable prices. However, the text suggests that the current U.S. economic situation is challenging this balance, with high unemployment and ongoing inflation.

- **Impact of U.S. Debt**:
  - The U.S. national debt is rising, and the text suggests that the country essentially borrows against future generations by issuing USTs. The rise in housing prices also supports this debt, as the money supply is tied to asset prices like real estate.

- **Cryptocurrency Trends**:
  - The text predicts that Bitcoin might rise due to the U.S. dollar's inability to strengthen, with a focus on the role of ETFs and the potential for other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) to perform well, particularly in light of the legal status of assets like XRP.

- **Housing Market and Liquidity**:
  - The government relies on the housing market to maintain liquidity. Rising house prices ensure people stay in debt, supporting the dollar. The text is skeptical of current market conditions, implying a potential decline in DXY if the housing market falters.

- **Economic Predictions**:
  - The text makes several predictions, including rising inflation, potential changes in Fed policy, and fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market based on these economic indicators.

This summary outlines the complex relationships between monetary policy, economic indicators, and global financial markets, while also offering a critical perspective on the trade-offs involved in economic development.
