Inspired by the intriguing music video "Repeat Stuff," I became curious about the potential subliminal messages it may contain. While I'm uncertain if these are intended as jokes, they subtly allude to a plethora of satanic references.

This project isn't about right or wrong, but rather about utilizing techniques like clustering or unsupervised learning, among others. Personally, I'm still learning and haven't completed my data science coursework.

By undertaking this project, we aim to discern patterns in satanic content, ultimately providing a tool to shield more conservative individuals from encountering such material. This could be a step towards raising awareness about potentially sensitive content, especially for those who hold conservative beliefs. Whether or not an afterlife exists, this endeavor can serve as a valuable exercise to refine your data science and machine learning skills.
