# Obsession

### 1. 

The sad thing about limerence is that people think you wake up one day and simply decide to become obsessed with someone. They think you choose to let everything that person says or does control your every move, your emotions, and your focus. But limerence isn’t a conscious decision. It’s never about the other person. It’s always about us—about the brain using this intense obsession as a coping mechanism to protect itself from difficult emotions. There’s the "limerence high," that euphoric state where everything feels perfect and your life seems amazing as long as you’re getting attention from the object of your obsession. And then there’s the "limerence low," the withdrawal period, which is what I’m going through now, where the protective Band-Aid is ripped away, and you’re forced to face all the emotions you were trying to avoid: the anxiety, the depression, the discomfort, the existential dread. 

For 13 years, my brain has used this obsession to shield me from those feelings, but when I get separated from the person I’ve fixated on, all those overwhelming emotions flood back to the surface. That’s why limerence is so hard to break free from—it’s not just about wanting someone, it’s about being consumed by the emotional need to avoid feeling anything else. It’s like being in a dream state where everything seems fine as long as that person is there, but human connections are fragile. They shift, they fade, and sometimes, they disappear altogether. Limerence doesn’t accept that. It wants to hold on, because it’s the brain’s way of coping, of protecting itself from facing the difficult realities of life. But giving that up is incredibly hard, and it requires a lot of emotional work, maybe even professional help.

I’ve been dealing with this for over a decade, and I’ve received judgment and ridicule for it. People have thought I was crazy, and I’ve gotten plenty of strange looks. But now I know this isn’t something I chose. It’s not a whim or a personality flaw—it’s an illness. It’s mental illness. And even though it’s humiliating, even though it’s painful, I know now that it’s out of my control. This is the reality of living with limerence. It’s not a choice—it’s something that happens to you. And sometimes, that’s the hardest thing to accept.

I made a video about limerence, which is the experience of obsessing over someone who doesn’t feel the same way about you. Afterward, I got some comments, like one that said, *“I am so hurt, but I needed to hear this. I just want to get over it, but a part of me can't let it go. I feel lost.”* And that really resonated with me. 

The most important thing to understand about limerence is that it’s always about how it makes you feel. It’s not about what actually happened between you and that person, and it’s not really about them, either. What we get addicted to is the way that person made us feel. We become fixated on the emotions we experienced—those moments of connection, joy, excitement, and peace. We replay those happy memories in our minds, and each time we do, we’re reliving those feelings of euphoria. That’s what keeps us stuck.

The real challenge, and the key to moving forward, is learning to create those feelings on your own, without needing the other person. If you can find a way to feel those emotions without being dependent on them for validation, then you can start to let go. That's the crucial step in breaking free from limerence. 

I hope that helps.

Are you obsessed with someone who doesn’t love you back? Are you pursuing someone who never said they were interested in you? Don’t worry, my friend—you’re caught up in something called limerence. It’s a very common phenomenon where we become romantically obsessed or deeply infatuated with someone who doesn’t return that energy. I’m going to explain a bit more about why this happens and how it works, so we can get some clarity on the situation.

The reasons I’ll be sharing are based on both research and my own personal experience with limerence. It’s especially common for people with PTSD, who often experience a lot of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and frustration in the world. Science shows that when we have romantic or sexual thoughts about someone, our brains release oxytocin, which is a bonding hormone. Repeatedly thinking about someone and releasing oxytocin can actually become physically addictive, which is why it’s so easy to get stuck in these obsessive thoughts. That’s how limerence takes hold.

For many people with PTSD, there’s also a maladaptive pattern we learn in childhood—the act of *earning* someone’s love. Many of us had abusive or narcissistic parents, and we grew up trying to modify our behavior to get their love, which we never received. So, as adults, when we become interested in someone who doesn’t like us back, our first instinct is to try to earn their love, just like we did as children. We exhaust ourselves trying to get someone to love us, because deep down, we’re trying to fill that primal need for love that we never got from our parents.

The only way out of limerence is to ask ourselves what we really want. If we love someone so much, and we’d be devastated if they don’t love us back—if we feel like we have nothing else to be happy about besides their love for us—that’s a red flag. We need to take a step back and evaluate what we truly want and need, without focusing on the other person. It’s never about them; it’s always about us.

We also need to learn how to regulate our nervous system so that we’re not constantly in fight-or-flight mode, dealing with overwhelming anxiety or depression. Because when we’re struggling with those intense emotions, limerence can feel like a relief—it’s the brain’s way of trying to calm itself down and find peace. To break free from limerence, we have to find ways to manage our emotions, so we don’t need to escape them through obsessive thoughts.

Many people mistakenly believe that romantic obsession, or limerence, is simply a mental state, something that exists only in your head, and that you can choose to stop obsessing at any time. However, limerence is not just a psychological condition; it can also be a physical one, affecting the very chemistry of your body. Let me share a story to illustrate this. 

At my old job, I was deeply in limerence with my boss. One day, we had a Christmas party, and I was so nervous about it that I only managed to get three hours of sleep the night before. I spent the entire day barely eating, forcing myself to eat only a few chicken tenders just to keep from passing out from sleep deprivation and hunger. By the time I got to the party around 9:00 PM, I was already running on empty. Despite this, I ended up drinking six or seven strong gin drinks, which were 95% gin, and gin is one of the strongest liquors, with a high ethanol concentration. Despite the lack of sleep and food, I felt totally fine. 

People at the party, who had seen me drunk before, were shocked by how normal I seemed. I didn’t slur my words, stumble, or do anything out of the ordinary. I was completely sober in behavior, even though I had consumed a large amount of alcohol. Normally, after such a combination of factors—lack of sleep, little food, and that much alcohol—I would have been severely intoxicated and likely kicked out of the party. But limerence had physically altered my body’s chemistry, enabling me to function at a level I otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. It gave me the strength to survive the day and handle the alcohol without becoming drunk. 

This experience made me realize that limerence is much more than just a psychological phenomenon. It affects both the mind and the body, altering your physical state and even granting you abilities that seem superhuman, thanks to the adrenaline it can generate. So, when people say it’s "all in your head" or that you can just "focus on something else," they don’t fully understand the powerful effects that limerence can have on your body. It’s not just a thought pattern—it's a deeply rooted condition that can literally change your body’s chemistry.

Romantic obsession, or *limerence*, changed my entire personality and nearly led to my death. Normally, I’m a very depressed person, and I don’t express much emotion. I tend to be withdrawn, distant, and cold, and I rarely engage with others. But when I experienced limerence, my personality completely shifted. Limerence triggered a kind of mania in me, making me overly energetic and talkative, especially after even the smallest positive interactions with my "favorite person" (FP). I became outgoing, constantly making jokes, laughing uncontrollably, and acting in silly, carefree ways that were completely out of character. At the time, I thought it might be the caffeine or stimulants I was using, but looking back, I realize it was the limerence itself that caused this drastic shift.

I would often find myself pacing around my room, jumping, moving my body erratically—it honestly looked like I belonged in a psych ward. The intrusive thoughts would flood my mind: thoughts like "she’s going to leave her husband and be with me" or "we’re going to have an affair." At first, I dismissed them as crazy, but eventually, I began to believe them. These delusions became part of the mania I was experiencing, fueled by the limerence. The mania wasn’t just euphoric; it also made me irritable, frustrated, and angry, often without warning. I didn’t even recognize these feelings as part of the mania, which made it all the more confusing and difficult to manage.

For a healthy person, attachment to someone might be a balanced, fulfilling experience. But for me, limerence consumed my entire life—every thought, every action. It even affected my sense of self and the way I saw the world. I became suicidal because of the intense emotional and psychological strain limerence caused me. I’d been dealing with it for 14 years, and the damage was evident: it made my anorexia worse, led me back into alcoholism, and weakened my immune system. I would get sick at least once a month from the constant emotional chaos.

I was humiliated and ashamed of my behavior. I felt completely out of control, as though my emotions, beliefs, and actions weren’t my own. I believed that death was the only way to escape the crushing grip of limerence. There’s a certain splendor to limerence—its highs can feel intoxicating—but underneath, it’s dangerous, toxic, and ultimately destructive. Looking back, I see just how sick I was while in the grip of limerence, and I didn’t even realize it at the time.

Limerence, the intense, obsessive infatuation with another person, can affect anyone, even those who have had a healthy childhood. While it often stems from attachment wounds, trauma, or abandonment issues, the addictive nature of limerence is rooted in a psychological concept known as *intermittent reinforcement*. This is when rewards are given randomly and unpredictably, which keeps individuals engaged and craving more. The behavior can be observed in a classic experiment with rats, where those who received a food pellet unpredictably became addicted to pressing a lever, while those who received food consistently did not. The same principle applies to human relationships, especially with emotionally unstable or avoidant individuals. The unpredictability of receiving attention or affection can cause people to become fixated on interacting with them, in hopes of receiving positive reinforcement.

The neurological basis for this addiction lies in the brain’s response to unexpected rewards. When an individual experiences random acts of kindness or affection, their brain releases a surge of dopamine, the "feel-good" chemical that is also triggered by drugs or risky behavior. This spike in dopamine creates a powerful, rewarding feeling, and the person becomes addicted to the high they receive from these unpredictable moments. This explains why people can stay in limerence for extended periods, even when the person they are infatuated with behaves inconsistently or hurts them. The pursuit of those rare moments of affection creates a cycle of craving, reinforcing the obsession, making it hard to break free, and leading individuals to stay emotionally tied to someone who might be emotionally unavailable or unstable.

People who are deeply depressed, lonely, or feel lost in life are particularly vulnerable to falling into limerence, which is an intense obsession with someone who occasionally shows them small acts of kindness. While this might seem irrational to some, it makes sense when you understand the emotional hunger that drives it. Those who have experienced neglect, abuse, or betrayal, such as from parents, peers, or even close friends, are often missing a fundamental human need—love. This lack of love can create an overwhelming sense of emptiness, making the occasional attention from another person feel like a rare and essential lifeline. Just as a starving person would cling to even a single crumb of food, a person starved of affection or emotional connection will hold onto any sign of love or care, desperately trying to fill that void.

Limerence, in this context, becomes a maladaptive coping mechanism that arises from this emotional hunger. It's not about the person being obsessed with, but rather about the desperate need to fulfill an unmet emotional need. It’s like a person who has been starving for love their entire life, receiving a tiny bit of affection, and clinging to it as though it might never come again. This desperation to hold onto whatever little love or attention comes their way is what keeps them trapped in limerence, repeating the cycle over and over again. The desire for love is universal, and when it’s absent, the person can become fixated on any small act that temporarily satisfies that need, even if it's fleeting or unpredictable.

Experiencing limerence does not invalidate the real relationships or connections that you have with others. While limerence can coexist with genuine relationships, it is often misunderstood as something inherently negative or obsessive, but it is really a personal struggle. For many, limerence arises from a deep emotional need, and it doesn’t necessarily reflect how they feel about the actual person—they may be deeply connected with someone, like a friend or someone they have common interests with, but their limerent feelings are often about filling an internal void. Even when experiencing limerence, it is possible to maintain real, meaningful connections with others without letting the obsession overshadow the relationship itself.

In some cases, as one spends more time with the person they are experiencing limerence toward, the intense feelings may fade as the fantasy and projection of desires begin to dissolve. Limerence thrives on separation and the gap between real interactions and idealized fantasy, but once the person becomes more familiar and humanized, the obsessive feelings can subside. This illustrates that limerence doesn’t prevent genuine intimacy or connection. It’s possible to have limerence for someone and still build a meaningful, authentic relationship once the fantasy gives way to reality. Ultimately, limerence is a complex emotional experience, but it doesn't define the entirety of a connection, nor does it negate the potential for true emotional closeness and mutual understanding.

If you're obsessed with someone and put them on a pedestal, it's crucial to understand that people are often aware of the power they hold over you, and some may exploit this to boost their own ego. When someone knows you adore them, worship them, or think they can do no wrong, they might use your admiration to make themselves feel better about who they are. They may continue giving you attention, even if it’s minimal or inconsistent, because it feeds their sense of importance. However, this dynamic can lead to you constantly giving, while they take without reciprocating. The key is to focus on their actions rather than their words. Pay attention to how they respond when they hurt you—do they apologize, or do they dismiss it as if it never happened? Are you always the one reaching out, or do they make an effort for you too?

Even if you were to get the relationship of your dreams, things likely wouldn’t change. The imbalance would remain, and you would continue trying to keep the connection together. It's important to remember that being used doesn’t mean you deserve that treatment. What people do reflects more on them than it does on you. If you're offering unconditional love, kindness, loyalty, and forgiveness, you deserve the same in return. Never settle for less just to feel loved. Often, when someone is using you, it's because they’re looking to feel validated or important, not because they truly care about you. Recognizing this early can prevent you from staying in relationships that drain you, and it’s a lesson I wish I had learned sooner.

I know I've said this before, but my attachment disorder is so severe that it has almost cost me my life on multiple occasions. I know people think it's crazy that I could invest so much into fleeting relationships—relationships that were never guaranteed to succeed or become anything more than superficial. But in a way, these relationships were all I had. Other forms of connection just don't meet my needs. All of these polite exchanges I have with people, even those who love and support me, aren't the same. I never realized how much I needed emotional connection until I had it and lost it. And when I lost it, it was so devastating that I would have rather not lived another day without it. 

Do you understand what I’m saying? I'm not saying it’s healthy. I’m not saying it’s not limerence or codependency. I’m not denying any of that. I know it’s wrong, but it doesn’t matter. Limerence is literally life-threatening for me. I don't know how to make people understand this. The next time I get into a relationship or meet someone I could have a profound emotional connection with, my life will be in danger. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it's the truth. I would need a therapist, a professional, to help me cope with the intensity of these feelings and the devastating pain of losing someone I’m emotionally connected to. Because if this happens again—if I go through this loss again—I swear, as God is my witness, I won't make it. 

I would never choose this. If I could flip a switch in my brain to turn it off, I would. Believe me, I’ve tried. I’ve studied this disorder. I’ve had it for 14 years. I’ve done everything I can to be logical, rational, and healthy. But it doesn’t matter what I do—it has a hold on me that I can’t explain. It has a power over me that never fails. That’s why I have to stay by myself. I have to stay away from people. I have to protect myself because dynamics like this are literally dangerous.


### 11. The only escape from obsession

If you're struggling to break free from romantic obsession, also known as limerence, there's one thing I can share that worked for me. I spent seven years trapped in limerence, constantly moving from one person to the next, caught in a never-ending cycle that felt impossible to escape. 

But the final person I became obsessed with was different. She was cold, and after we parted ways, she completely shut me out—no contact, no desire to engage. From the perspective of limerence, this felt like the worst punishment imaginable. But, in hindsight, it was actually a blessing in disguise.

If you're romantically obsessed with someone, you need to do the opposite of what limerence urges you to do: cut all contact. No messages, no social media interactions—nothing. Every time you engage with that person, you're feeding your brain with addictive chemicals that make it even harder to move on. 

We're also often haunted by the positive memories we've created with that person, and the feelings that come with them. I spent almost a year and a half replaying those memories over and over. But one day, out of nowhere, I woke up and realized I no longer had an emotional reaction to those memories. My brain had become so desensitized to them.

In my experience, getting out of limerence is all about cutting ties with the person and desensitizing yourself to the emotions and memories attached to them. Over time, your brain will adjust to their absence and stop reacting to the memories you associate with them. 

It won't be easy, and it might take a long time—maybe even a year or more—but with patience, you will get through it. It's incredibly painful, and there were moments when I felt like giving up, wishing I could escape the hurt. But if you hold on, even through the toughest days, you can make it to the other side. It's possible, even if it feels impossible right now.

### 12. Obsession is encouraged by society

In today's world, many people are becoming obsessed with others due to the pervasive loneliness in modern society. This is largely driven by the fact that most of our social interactions are now online, which is not enough to keep us emotionally stable. Real, in-person connections are necessary to regulate dopamine levels in our brains. For those who lack meaningful social interaction, this deficiency can lead to dopamine imbalances, making them crave the high that comes from connecting with someone who truly makes them feel seen or understood.

When we become fixated on certain individuals, it's often not about the person themselves, but about the dopamine rush we experience from that connection. In fact, our brains interpret meaningful social interaction as crucial for survival. If we're isolated for too long, our subconscious perceives that we lack security, resources, and support, leading to the feeling that our survival is threatened. This is why the absence of a person we’re obsessed with can trigger intense feelings of anxiety or adrenaline.

Modern society, with its emphasis on individualism and isolation, fosters a disordered form of attachment. People are expected to carry the full weight of their emotional needs in their relationships, leaving them vulnerable to unhealthy dependencies. The way we live today is vastly different from how humans were naturally meant to exist, which is why many of us experience such intense, sometimes damaging attachments. Even with a supportive family or good friends, it's possible to develop an unhealthy obsession with another person, especially if they are emotionally unpredictable or mimic the behavior of a primary caregiver.

This phenomenon is known as "intermittent reinforcement," which is when we become addicted to the highs and lows of an unstable relationship. Just like gambling, where a person might lose everything for the chance of winning, we may keep pursuing someone who offers us sporadic acts of kindness because of the dopamine rush we get when we experience it. Additionally, if a person reminds us of someone from our past—such as a parent figure—it can trigger a deep emotional need to repair unresolved wounds, further fueling obsession.

The truth is, our obsession with people is not a sign of madness but a product of modern social structures. These structures foster isolation, encourage unhealthy attachment patterns, and create a cycle of dopamine addiction. In today's world, it's hard to form meaningful connections, and as a result, many people are struggling with attachment disorders. Obsession, in many ways, has become a byproduct of the way we live today.
