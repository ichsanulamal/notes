**Bitcoin Drop - Guys, it's normal**

To stay calm, let's analyze the global picture. Recently, the M2 Supply increased. M2 Supply is the total amount of new dollars printed, excluding the ones already circulating. You can check this on the Federal Reserve's website.

**M2 Supply May Increase:**
- The highest since February 2023.
- Confirmed as a source of US liquidity along with debt and RRP (Reverse Repo).

**Bitcoin's Relationship with M2 Supply:**
- Bitcoin thrives on newly printed money (M2 Supply).
- If the economy hasn't doubled but the Fed's assets have, the extra money comes from M2 Supply, fueling Bitcoin.

**M2 Supply Effect:**
- Impacts the financial market a year later. The current market situation reflects June 2023's M2 Supply.
- Liquidity dried up because M2 Supply decreased and interest rates stayed high at 5.5%.

**Bitcoin in June 2023:**
- Price was $30K. By June 2024, it doubled. 

**US Inflation Peak (June 2022):**
- Highest at 9.1%.
- M2 Supply first dropped, marking Bitcoin's bottom in November 2022 at $15K.
- Impact felt 5 months later; marked the buy-in point at $16K, and sell at $32K for a 100% gain.

**Bitcoin Market Calls:**
- Encouraged followers to buy Bitcoin in small amounts collectively.

**M2 Supply 2024 Impact:**
- First positive this year.
- Impact will peak in February 2025.
- Short-term thinkers focus month-to-month; thus, the impact might be felt by July 2024.
- Aiming for a 20% gain seems reasonable.

**Ideal Scenario for Bitcoin:**
- If M2 Supply rises, RRP grows slowly, and US debt increases moderately, Bitcoin should rise steadily.
- If M2 Supply rises significantly and RRP drops, with US debt hitting $35T, it would lead to a market "party" (boom).

**Investment Strategy:**
- Take profits (TP) when signaled.
- Aim for 20% gains repeatedly, leading to substantial overall returns.
- The main goal is security, not just profit. If an investment is unsafe, it should be avoided.

**Reverse Repo (RRP):**
- RRP involves the central bank borrowing money from the market using government securities as collateral.
- A rising RRP means tighter liquidity.

**Concerns:**
- If both RRP and M2 Supply rise, M2 should outpace RRP.
- If RRP rises faster, money becomes harder to find, affecting the economy negatively, especially during election periods.

**Explanation and Strategy:**
- Stay calm and informed.
- Understanding RRP and its implications helps in making better investment decisions.

Before we discuss next week's data, let's review this week's data to understand what we got right and what we got wrong.

**China's Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Predicted to drop. This means China is likely using its reserves. China's gold purchases have decreased. Is China intervening in the market? No, because the Yuan is not weakening; it's actually getting stronger.

**SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate):** This has increased, indicating that liquidity (availability of money) is drying up. 

**US Consumer Credit:** Increased by $11 billion, meaning people are using credit cards to cover expenses. 

**Hawkish vs. Dovish:** Powell was not hawkish (favoring higher interest rates to fight inflation), implying a dovish stance (favoring lower interest rates). He said they won't raise interest rates and don't need to wait for inflation to hit 2% to ease monetary policy.

**China's CPI (Consumer Price Index):** Below the forecast at 0.2%. If China's inflation decreases, the Yuan strengthens, leading to deflation, which can harm the economy.

**China's M2 Money Supply:** Increased slightly by 0.22%, or 7% annually.

**US Inflation:** Predicted correctly to drop to 3%. Both Chinese and US inflation decreasing could mean either the US is manipulating numbers due to the upcoming election, or liquidity is truly drying up. 

**China's Foreign Exchange Reserves:** Over $3 trillion, indicating tight liquidity because funds are being redirected.

**Producer Price Index (PPI):** Expected to drop, showing the Fed is reducing inflation by sacrificing jobs. If it rises, it won't be much due to lack of demand.

**US Dollar Index (DXY):** Dropped to nearly 104.00 due to the accurate data.

**Chart Analysis:** Data trends are mostly correct.

---

**Next Week's Data:**

**Monday, July 15, 2024:**

- **China's GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** If inflation decreases, GDP might fall below 5.3%. The government may need to increase liquidity but avoid it leaking to the US by replacing foreign stock ownership with local stocks. This is why foreign businesses are pressured to leave China.

- **Bitcoin:** If GDP falls, it could signal that the government will inject liquidity into the market, boosting Bitcoin. The aim is to prevent deeper deflation and stimulate the economy.

- **China's Retail Sales:** If US retail sales drop, China's retail sales should rise, putting pressure on the dollar and causing DXY to fall. Yuan should strengthen unless intentionally weakened.

- **China's Housing Prices:** Expected to continue falling. Lower housing prices will shift investments from property to equities (stocks), protecting against future inflation when China shifts reserves from the dollar.

- **Fed Powell & Daly Speaking:** Expected to provide minor corrections. Powell cannot remain dovish indefinitely.

**Tuesday, July 16, 2024:**

- **US Retail Sales:** Expected to show a decline, though previous numbers might be revised to appear better. If retail sales increase, DXY will rise. If they decrease, DXY falls and Bitcoin rises.

- **NAHB Housing Price Index:** US housing prices are expected to drop, indicating drying liquidity. Rising SOFR and subsidized housing prices suggest corporate rather than individual purchases.

**Wednesday, July 17, 2024:**

- **Housing Starts:** Expected to drop along with falling housing prices, leading to higher Bitcoin prices. If actual numbers are better than predicted, DXY might not be strong.

- **Building Permits:** Expected to drop due to a lack of money among the population for new homes.

- **Beige Book:** A summary of economic opinions compiled by the Fed, likely to present a favorable image of the government.

**Thursday, July 18, 2024:**

- **Jobless Claims:** Expected to be manipulated. Lower unemployment is seen as positive, indicating that the Fed might start easing policy and thus reducing the DXY.

**Friday, July 19, 2024:**

- **William and Bostic Speaking:** Likely to provide further insights or corrections.

**Bitcoin Market Analysis:**

Market makers, such as Jane Street, are influential in controlling Bitcoin prices, particularly through futures and ETFs. This control allows them to influence prices despite positive economic data that should push Bitcoin higher.

**Key Points:**

- After positive economic data, Jane Street short-sells Bitcoin, which is then followed by similar actions in Asian markets, keeping Bitcoin prices suppressed.
- Asset managers like BlackRock buy Bitcoin ETFs at these lower prices, consolidating control over Bitcoin in the hands of US entities.
- This manipulation is evident in the discrepancy between economic data and Bitcoin's market reaction.

**Conclusion:**

- **Bitcoin Trend:** After a short-sell by Jane Street and subsequent Asian market actions, Bitcoin might initially drop but could recover as asset managers continue to buy ETFs.
- **Economic Data Impact:** Economic indicators and their manipulation affect Bitcoin and other assets, revealing deeper market strategies by major players.
